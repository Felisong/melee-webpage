### Cloning this Repository

1. Navigate to the main page of the repository you want to clone on GitHub.com.
2. Click on the green "Code" button near the top of the page.
3. In the dropdown menu, you'll see three options for cloning:
   HTTPS
   SSH
   GitHub CLI
   Choose your preferred method. For most users, HTTPS is the simplest option.
4. Click the copy button next to the URL to copy it to your clipboard.
5. Open your terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be created.
7. Type git clone followed by a space and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It should look like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
```

8. Press Enter to execute the command.
9. Wait for the cloning process to complete. You'll see output indicating the progress.
10. Once finished, you'll have a local copy of the repository in a new directory named after the repository.
    To verify, you can change into the new directory using the cd command and list its contents with ls (on Unix-based systems) or dir (on Windows).

I made mostly everything myself but had used perplexity.ai pretty intensively to figure out how some things worked.
I took the icons from [here](<https://www.ssbwiki.com/Category:Head_icons_(SSBM)>)
