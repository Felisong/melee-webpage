        <h2>  Super Smash Bros Melee is...</h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        <!-- A crossover fighting video game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the GameCube, released in 2001. It is the second installment in the Super Smash Bros. series, following the original Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64. The game features characters from various Nintendo franchises, including Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, PokÃ©mon, and Donkey Kong, among others12.
        Gameplay Mechanics
        Melee distinguishes itself from traditional fighting games through its unique gameplay mechanics:
        Damage System: Instead of a health bar, players accumulate damage represented as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the further a character can be knocked off the stage, leading to their elimination13.
        Objective: The primary goal is to knock opponents off the stage rather than depleting their health. This creates a dynamic and fast-paced environment where players must focus on positioning and edge-guarding23.
        Game Modes
        Melee offers various modes for both single-player and multiplayer experiences:
        Single-player Modes: Includes "Classic Mode," where players battle through a series of opponents, and "Adventure Mode," which incorporates platforming elements alongside combat challenges12.
        Multiplayer Modes: Supports up to four players in various formats, including free-for-all battles and team matches. Popular modes include "Stock" (where players have a set number of lives) and "Time" (where players compete for the most KOs within a time limit)12.
        Character Roster
        Melee features a diverse roster of characters, with 25 playable fighters (26 if considering Zelda and Sheik as separate). Characters are drawn from popular Nintendo franchises, and some, like Marth and Roy from Fire Emblem, were relatively unknown outside Japan at the time of release13.
        Competitive Scene
        Super Smash Bros. Melee has maintained a vibrant competitive community since its release. It is often praised for its high skill ceiling, allowing for advanced techniques and deep strategic play. Many players appreciate its fast-paced gameplay and technical depth, which contrasts with later entries in the series that adopted different design philosophies4.
        Overall, Melee is celebrated not only for its engaging gameplay but also for its lasting impact on the fighting game community and its role in shaping competitive gaming culture. -->
       <p> A crossover figthing game with classic Nintendo Characters of it's time. It released in 2001, developed by Hal Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Gamecube. The game is the second instalment in the Super Smash Bros. series, following the original Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64.</p>
       <p> Melee distinguishes itself from other fighting games through it's unique gameplay mechanics. The damage system is based on percentage, and the higher percentage you get to, the farther your character can be knocked back by attacks. The goal is to knock opponents off the stage, rather than depleting their health. This goal forces players to focus on their positioning and edge guarding. </p>
       <p> Melee features multiple game modes, both singe-player and multiplayer. The highlight to me is the competitive game mode, versus mode. In which two players face off with 4 stocks (lives) each. There are 25 playable fighters (26 if you consider Sheik and Zelda seperately). Although there is a tier list on how good or bad these characters are, competent players have proven time and time again that all characters can give a good fight. </p>
       <p> Super Smash Bros. Melee has maintained an active and passionate competitive community since it has released. It has a high skill ceiling, allowing for advanced techniques and strategic play. The gameplay is fast-paced and technical, which later installments lose in return to make the games more party oriented.</p>
